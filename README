Team Pokemon's repository for CREATE's autonomous car project. 

Currently, all references to Pi libraries have been stripped to make developing the software easier on a desktop. Porting the software back to Pi will occur when the team has ready access to a machine or a properly configured simulator. 

Build Instructions: 
Navigate to main directory with the Makefile. Type 'make' into terminal and hit enter. 

Run instructions: 
Comment/uncomment relevant hash defines at the top of main.cpp. 

	#define STILL_IMAGES:	Use the sample images provided. 
	#define DISP_TEST: 	Display the image with objects/paths plotted. 
	#define OUTPUT_IMAGE:	Export images with object/path plots into separate files. 

Navigate to main directory with main.cpp. Type 'sudo ./bin/main' and hit enter to run. Run from main directory so the program correctly identifies the image read/write file path. Alternatively, run 'main' (symlink to ./bin/main) from the main directory.
